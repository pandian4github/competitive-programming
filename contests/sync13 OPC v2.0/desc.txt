Design a calculator to calculate your GPA. Possible grades are S, A, B, C, D and E. S corresponds to 10 credits, A to 9, B to 8, C to 7, D to 6 and E to 5. There are n subjects. Each subject has a number of credits and the grade obtained by the student.
GPA of the student is the summation of grades obtained multiplied by the number of credits for each student divided by the total number of credits. for example,
if input is n = 3. three subjects have credits 3, 4 and 5. a student has obtained grade S, A and B respectively, then GPA = (3*10 + 4*9 + 5*8)/(3+4+5)

input:
First line consists of t, the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 20)
Each test case starts with n, the number of subjects (1 <= n <= 16)
next n lines consist of credits for that subject followed by grade obtained by the student

output:
for each test case, print the GPA of the student rounded off to two decimal places.
