RLE

	You need to perform run length encoding on a given string. The encoding is as follows : 'consecutive character count' followed by '!' followed by the 'character'. 
Do not encode the characters unless they lead to compression !

First line consists of t, the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 10)
Next t lines consist of a string, s with |s| <= 100000

For each test case, output a single line printing the run length encoding of the input string
