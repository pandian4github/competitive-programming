Queue in maze
	There is a rectangular maze of size n*m (n rows and m columns). Each cell may be a free cell('.') or a blockade('#'). A queue is to be formed in the maze such 
that it passes only through the free cells and it starts from one of the four corners. Additionally, it has the following rules, if the queue starts from
	a) top left corner, it can extend downwards and rightwards
	b) top right corner, it can extend downwards and leftwards
	c) bottom right corner, it can extend upwards and leftwards
	d) bottom left corner, it can extend upwards and rightwards
Given these information and given a maze, find the maximum length of any queue that can be formed in the maze.

First line consists of t, the number of test cases ( 1 <= t <= 30)
Next t sets of test cases each consist of a single line containing two space separated integers, n and m. ( 1 <= n, m <= 500)
Followed by this line, there will be n lines each of m characters. Each character will either be a '.' or a '#'

For each test case, print a single line containing the maximum length of the queue.
