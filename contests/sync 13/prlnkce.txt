Jaavs likes to make a new pearl necklace for his girlfriend. He collects the pearls and places them on a table in a particular order. All pearls are only of three 
types “r”,”s”,”t”. Now, Jaavs wants to make a pearl necklace such that it shouldn't contain all three types of pearls. To make a necklace, pearls should be taken 
sequentially. Jaavs likes to know how many different types of necklaces he can make. Help him find it.

Note: Each necklace should contain at least a single pearl. And, no two pearls in the string are identical which means that two pearls of the same color are treated
differently because they are of different shade and tint.

First line consists of t, the number of test cases (1 <= t <=30)
Next t lines consist of string s with only lowercase r, s and t (1 <= |s| <= 10^6)

For each input string, print the required number of necklaces he can make.

Explanation for testcase #1 :
The possible necklaces are : {r, s, t, rs, st}
rst is not possible because it contains all three pearls
rt is not possible because the pearls are not continuous
